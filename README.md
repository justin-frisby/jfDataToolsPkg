# jfDataToolsPkg

This is a very, very basic package I created for a data science class. The package only has one function which allows someone to get NFL rushing data based on a few arguments {getRushType(season, run_type, start_week, end_week, graph = TRUE)}, which I probably could have named better looking back on it.
